		<p class="centre">CERULEANS, HUMANS and AVIANS live together in the World. The CERULEANS are powerful beings, and their civilisation has been around for a very long time.

Long ago, before the HUMANS and AVIANS existed, a terrible war was fought - MAYI, an extremely powerful entity, attacked the CERULEAN EMPIRE, and built an army by controlling the minds of those he had vanquished. The CERULEAN EMPIRE was overwhelmed by MAYI’s strength, and to achieve victory the EMPEROR was forced to activate the “Kavallerist Program”, whose goal was to transform, upon proper stimulation, all CERULEANS who had been subjected to it into supersoldiers - stronger, healthier, and more agile. To ensure victory, the EMPEROR subjected every living CERULEAN to the Program.

The Kavallerist Program was a complete success: MAYI’s forces were overwhelmed by the new CERULEAN army and was finally defeated, although those freed from his control lost most of their cognitive capacities as a result. The augmentations the CERULEANS had underwent to survive MAYI’S ONSLAUGHT were hereditary, so that in case of another war the EMPIRE could be always ready to defend itself.

Today, much has changed. The rise of the HUMAN and AVIAN civilisation have made a lasting impact on the world, and although they do not live together, HUMANS, AVIANS and CERULEANS are at peace and always ready to assist eachother.</p>

Also, nothing in here is official, just ideas that will very much likely become the core of the game. Most of it may not even make it into the final product. Thanks for reading !</p>
